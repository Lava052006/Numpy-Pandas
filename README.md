# Numpy-Pandas


# 📊 Student Performance Analysis using Pandas & NumPy

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes student exam performance to understand how **demographics, parental background, and test preparation** influence academic outcomes.
The analysis uses **Pandas and NumPy** to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, group-based analysis, and insight generation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze student scores across math, reading, and writing
* Study the impact of test preparation programs
* Identify performance gaps across gender and parental education
* Generate actionable insights using data-driven analysis

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **Source:** Kaggle – Student Performance Dataset
* **Records:** Student exam results
* **Subjects:** Math, Reading, Writing
* **Additional Attributes:**

  * Gender
  * Parental level of education
  * Lunch type
  * Test preparation course

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

The following features were created to enhance analysis:

* **Overall Score:** Average of math, reading, and writing scores
* **Performance Level:** Categorized as Low, Medium, or High based on overall score
* **Score Consistency:** Standard deviation across subject scores

These engineered features enable deeper performance comparisons and segmentation.

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Insights

### 📈 Test Preparation Impact

Students who completed test preparation courses consistently scored higher across all subjects.

### 👩‍🎓 Gender-Based Performance

* Female students performed better in reading and writing
* Math performance was relatively balanced across genders

### 🎓 Parental Education Effect

Higher parental education levels showed a positive correlation with student performance
*(Correlation does not imply causation)*

### ⚖️ Consistency vs Performance

High-performing students exhibited lower score variability, indicating balanced academic strength.
